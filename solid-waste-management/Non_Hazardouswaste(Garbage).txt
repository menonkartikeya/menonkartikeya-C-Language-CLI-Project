We suggest:

1. Disposing off or composting is a natural bio-degradation process for organic wastes (kitchen waste and plant remains) 
    that converts them into nutrient-filled food for plants. 
    This is a common technique in organic farming, where the organic materials sit in one place for months to allow for decomposition.

2. Bio-gas plant :- The process of anaerobic fermentation will take place in the bio-gas plant tank, to generate biological gas (biogas).
                           Biogas is environment friendly and has various applications like: cooking, drying, cooling, heating etc. 
                           It is used in producing electricity, methanol and production of steam.
