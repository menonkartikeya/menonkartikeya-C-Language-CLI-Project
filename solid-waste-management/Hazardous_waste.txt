Hazardous wastes must undergo different treatments in order to stabilize and dispose of them. 
Most flammable materials can be recycled into industrial fuel. 
Some materials with hazardous constituents can be recycled, such as lead acid batteries.

We suggest:

1.THREE R's:
        Reduce
        Reuse
        Recycle

      If there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse. 
      So, reduce the waste generated by limiting the usage of items as much is necessary or by multi-using items.

      Reusing old items by restoring them, using rechargaeble batteries,etc. 

      Transforming again a waste item into the raw material that can be shaped into a new item is recycling. 
      It is most suitable waste management method for especially hazardous wastes.

2. Incineration, destruction and waste-to-energy:

    By incinerating them at a high temperature, flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. 
    Controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant to reduce the amount of harmful byproducts produced.
    The heat released from burning converts water into steam, which is then sent to a turbine generator to produce electricity.
