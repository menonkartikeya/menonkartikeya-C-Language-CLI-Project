Electronic waste or e-waste includes discarded computer equipment, televisions, telephones, and a variety of other electronic devices. 
Concern over this type of waste is escalating. 
Lead, mercury, and cadmium are among the materials of concern in electronic devices, and governmental policies may be required to regulate their recycling and disposal.

We suggest:
THREE R's:
        Reduce
        Reuse
        Recycle

      If there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse. 
      So, reduce the waste generated by limiting the usage of items as much is necessary or by multi-using items.

      Reusing old items by restoring them, using rechargaeble batteries,etc. 

      Transforming again a waste item into the raw material that can be shaped into a new item is recycling.
