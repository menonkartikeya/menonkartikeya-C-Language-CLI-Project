TRASH are bulky rubbish items such as refrigerators, couches or large tree stumps. 
Trash requires special collection and handling.

We suggest:
1. THREE R's:
        Reduce
        Reuse
        Recycle

      If there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse. 
      So, reduce the waste generated by limiting the usage of items as much is necessary or by multi-using items.

      Reusing old items by restoring them, etc. 

      Transforming again a waste item into the raw material that can be shaped into a new item is recycling.

2. Waste-to-energy:
    By incinerating them at a high temperature, flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. 
    The heat released from burning converts water into steam, which is then sent to a turbine generator to produce electricity.
