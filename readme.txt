This is a project I made using C++ language.
It is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Project for "Environmental Studies" subject, titled "Solid Waste Management".

This includes concepts of classes, file handling, vectors, stringstream, etc.

It is a menu-driven program, with many functionalities like:
-> Entering, viewing, editing the data, 
-> Reading and writing from csv as well as text files,
-> Operating on strings and class objects, and many more.



This program deals with details of waste from its generation to its treatment or disposal.
This program would :
    A. Help user to enter, view and edit details of wastes generated and also waste-storage spaces.
    B. Give information on how the waste should be managed.

Benefits of this program:
    1. Help user keep all the waste details in an organized and safer way in a computer.
    2. This would reduce the manual work and virtually data can be stored and viewed any time.
    3. The core of the program is a linear programming algorithm that finds solution for a waste that how it should be managed.
    4. Also this program would help in:
                 Keeping the environment clean and fresh
                 Saving the Earth and conserving energy
                 Reducing environmental pollution
                 Creating employment
